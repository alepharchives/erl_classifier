Naive Bayes classifier in Erlang

The classifier can be used to solve any-of classifications using the aproach of 
N two-class classifiers one for each class. Classification in the classifiers
will therefore be classification for class c or it's complement Ä‰. 




Note: All files are expected to be UTF8 encoded.



Stop word lists:

     - Are kept in priv/stopwords/
     - Must be named lang.stopwords, where lang is the language of the stop words in the file.
     - Avoid multiple . in the filenames because only the first part up to the first . will be extracted as the language.
     - Generelly not much checking is done on the filenames and their content.

Setting up the mnesia datastore:

-- make console
-- mnesia:create_schema([node()]).
-- mnesia:start().
-- application:start(erl_classifier).
-- ec_store:init_tables().
-- ec_sport_demo:train().

To startup after the mnesia datastore has been initialized:

-- make console
-- mnesia:start().
-- application:start(erl_classifier).



Classifying a document after the above storage initialization:

-- ec_classifier:classify(<<"your text in danish"/utf8>>).
