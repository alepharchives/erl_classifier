Naive Bayes classifier in Erlang


Note: All files are expected to be UTF8 encoded.



Stop word lists:

     - Are are kept in priv/stopwords/
     - Must be named lang.stopwords where lang the language of the stop words
     - Avoid multiple . in the filenames because only the first part up to the
       first . will be extracted as the language.
     - Generelly not much checking is done on the filenames and their content.

Setting up the mnesia datastore:

-- make console
-- mnesia:create_schema([node()]).
-- mnesia:start().
-- application:start(erl_classifier).
-- ec_store:init_tables().
-- ec_sport_demo:train().

To startup after the mnesia datastore has been initialized:

-- make console
-- mnesia:start().
-- application:start(erl_classifier).



Classifying a document after the above storage initialization:

-- ec_classifier:classify(<<"you text in danish"/utf8>>).
